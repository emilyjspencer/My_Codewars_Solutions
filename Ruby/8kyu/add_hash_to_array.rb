# Push a hash/an object into array
# You are trying to put a hash in ruby or an object in javascript or java 
# into an array, but it always returns error, solve it and keep it as simple as possible!

items = Array.new
items << {:a => "b", :c => "d"}




# Could also do: 

# items = []
#items.push({{:a => "b", :c => "d"})
